# About

This repository provides a ready-to-use `Python` toolkit for computing simple **public transport travel time matrices**. It is designed to be **fast**, **convenient**, and **minimalist**, requiring only three input shapefiles:

1. **Points** to be connected (e.g. centroids of spatial units),
2. **Public transport stations** (e.g. subway stops), and
3. **Network geometry** (e.g. subway lines).

## Key Features

- **Customizable speeds**: Choose walking and transit speeds (e.g. 4 km/h and 35 km/h).
- **Smart routing**: Computes least-time routes for all origin-destination pairs, using the network **only if faster** than walking.
- **Flexible station choice**: No fixed assignment to nearest station — the toolkit chooses the most time-efficient entry and exit.
- **Automatic snapping and connections**: Stations are snapped to the network, and all points are connected to all stations automatically.
- **Output**: 
  - Travel time matrix (`.csv`) where travel times are measured in minutes
  - Enriched shapefile with mean travel times per point
  - Optional visualization of travel time map

## Getting Started

If you are **new to Python**, you can download the Anaconda distrbution from [this website](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Open the script `TTMATRIX.py` in Spyder (Scientific Python Development Environment) is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for scientific computing and data analysis using Python. Of course, you can also use any other IDE. When executing `TTMATRIX.py` all dependencies are installed automatically if missing. The script can be copied and run from any folder on your machine. The chosen directory must a subfolder **Input** containing the three input shapefiles and a subfolder **Outputs** where the outputs will be saved. The input shapefiles can use projectsion in projected meter units or decimal degrees (WGS1984). But they should all be in the **same projection**.

You can specify all relevant parameters in the below part of the code. There is no need to make any adjustments elsewhere.

```python
# === USER SETTINGS ===
working_dir = r"A:\Research\TTMATRIX-toolkit"  # Select your working directory here
points_file = "B4m_com_ll.shp"                 # Select the point shapefile containing locations here (origins/destinations)
stations_file = "UBahn2020_stops_ll.shp"       # Select the point shapefile containing stations to enter and exit the network here
network_file = "UBahn2020_lines_ll.shp"        # Select the polyline shapefile containing network here
point_id_field = "STAT_BLOCK"                  # Select the identifier variable in your location shapefile here
walking_speed_kmh = 4                          # Select the speed off the network (e.g. walking) here
network_speed_kmh = 35                         # Select the speed on the network (e.g. subways) here
output_matrix_file = "TTMATRIX-final.csv"      # Select the name of the outcome travel time matrix here
output_shapefile = "ATT-final.shp"             # Select the name of the outcome shapefile with average travel times here
```

## Methodology: Routing and Graph Construction

The travel time matrix is computed by constructing an **augmented graph** that combines the **public transport network** with **walking access**. The graph is undirected and weighted by travel times in minutes. The following nodes and edges are included:

### 1. Transit Network Edges
- Each transit line (e.g., a subway line) is decomposed into segments between consecutive coordinates.
- Each segment becomes an edge with a weight equal to the travel time:
time = (segment length in km) / (network speed in km/h) × 60

### 2. Station Nodes and Snapping Edges
- Each public transport station is added as a node.
- Each station is connected to its **nearest point** on the network via a **nearly zero-cost edge** (~0.0001 minutes) to allow entry and exit from the network.

### 3. Point Nodes and Access Edges
- Each point to be included in the travel time matrix is added as a node.
- Each point is connected to **every station** by a walking edge, weighted by:
time = (Euclidean distance in km) / (walking speed in km/h) × 60


- This design allows the algorithm to determine the most efficient **entry and exit** stations for each journey — not just the nearest ones.

### 4. Direct Walking Edges Between Points
- To allow for walking-only trips, a walking edge is also added between every unique pair of points.
- These are calculated the same way using walking speed and straight-line distance.

### 5. Shortest Path Computation
- The resulting graph allows both multimodal and walking-only routes.
- For each origin point, the shortest paths to all other points are computed using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**, weighted by travel time.
- The final travel time between any two points reflects the **least-cost route**, whether via transit or direct walking.

### Output
- A complete origin-destination travel time matrix (`.csv`)
- A shapefile enriched with each point’s **mean travel time**
- An optional map visualization of accessibility patterns
